- [Medicare Physician Compare](https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare)
```

### Option 2: General Guidance
Provide search keywords instead of specific recommendations:
```python
## 🏥 Finding Appropriate Care
Search online for:
- "dermatologist near me"
- "skin cancer specialist [your city]"
- "melanoma treatment center [your area]"
```

### Option 3: Resource List
Include national/international resources:
```python
## 📞 Healthcare Resources
- American Cancer Society: 1-800-227-2345
- Skin Cancer Foundation: skincancer.org
- National Cancer Institute: cancer.gov
```
