- ✅ **40% faster** report generation

## 🔍 Sample Report Content

### Example: Melanoma Detection

```markdown
## 📋 Condition Overview

Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer that develops 
from melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells. It can appear 
as a new spot or an existing mole that changes in color, size, 
or shape. Early detection is crucial as melanoma can spread to 
other parts of the body if left untreated. This AI detection 
indicates characteristics consistent with melanoma based on 
visual analysis.

## ⚠️ Important Precautions

• Consult a board-certified dermatologist immediately for 
  professional evaluation and biopsy if recommended
• Avoid further sun exposure to the affected area
• Do not attempt to remove or treat the lesion yourself
• Keep a detailed record of any changes in size, color, or 
  texture
• Inform your healthcare provider about your family history 
  of skin cancer
• This AI analysis is for screening purposes only and must 
  be confirmed by medical professionals
```

### Example: Benign Keratosis

```markdown
## 📋 Condition Overview

Benign keratosis, also known as seborrheic keratosis, is a 
common non-cancerous skin growth. These lesions are usually 
harmless and don't require treatment unless they cause 
irritation or cosmetic concerns. They typically appear as 
brown, black, or tan growths with a waxy or scaly texture. 
While benign, professional evaluation helps ensure accurate 
diagnosis.

## ⚠️ Important Precautions

• Schedule a routine dermatology appointment for professional 
  confirmation
• Monitor for any changes in appearance, though malignant 
  transformation is extremely rare
• Avoid picking, scratching, or irritating the lesion
• Protect the area from sun damage with appropriate sunscreen
• If the lesion becomes irritated, bleeds, or changes rapidly, 
  seek medical attention
• Regular skin self-examinations are recommended for overall 
  skin health
```
