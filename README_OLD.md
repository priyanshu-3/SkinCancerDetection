## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Module not found" errors**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Camera not working**:

   - Ensure HTTPS connection for camera access
   - Grant camera permissions in browser
   - Try different browser (Chrome recommended)

3. **Model loading errors**:

   - Verify Roboflow API key and model details
   - Check internet connection
   - Ensure model is publicly accessible

4. **LLM response errors**:
   - Verify Groq API key
   - Check API quota/limits
   - Ensure stable internet connection

### Camera Capture Issues

If the camera is not working, try these solutions:

1. **Browser Permissions**: Allow camera access when prompted
2. **HTTPS Requirement**: Modern browsers require HTTPS for camera access. For local development:
   - Use `http://localhost:5000` or `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
   - Avoid IP addresses like `http://192.168.x.x:5000`
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (latest versions)
4. **Multiple Cameras**: If you have multiple cameras, the app uses the front camera on mobile
5. **Permissions Reset**: Clear browser permissions and try again
6. **Console Debug**: Press F12 to open developer tools and check for errors

**Quick Test**: Run `debug_camera.bat` for troubleshooting information.
