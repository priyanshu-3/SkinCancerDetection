   - Or navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/history`

2. **Search Records**
   - Use the search bar to find specific patients or diagnoses
   - Press Enter or click "Search" button

3. **Filter Records**
   - Click "Filters" button to expand advanced filters
   - Select date range and/or specific diagnosis
   - Click "Search" to apply filters
   - Click "Reset Filters" to clear all filters

4. **View Details**

### For Developers:

1. **Backend Setup**
   - Database migrations are automatic (SQLAlchemy)
   - Analysis records are saved automatically after each diagnosis
   - All API endpoints require authentication (`@login_required`)

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Uses fetch API with credentials for authentication
   - Base URL: `http://localhost:5001`
   - All state management handled with React hooks

## üîê Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All history endpoints require user login
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own records
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses parameterized queries
- **CORS Protection**: Restricted to localhost origins
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie-based sessions

## üìä Data Persistence

- All analysis results are automatically saved to the database
- No user action required - happens in background
- Includes full analysis data for future reference
- Images and reports are stored in `static/uploads/`
- Database uses SQLite (can be upgraded to PostgreSQL)

## üéØ Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Pagination for large datasets
- Advanced sorting (click column headers)
- Comparison view (compare multiple analyses)
- Share records with doctors
- Email reports functionality
- Data visualization charts
- Archive/delete old records
- Bulk operations
- PDF report viewer in browser

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Issue: History page shows no records**
- Solution: Perform at least one analysis from the dashboard
- Records are only saved after analysis is complete

**Issue: CSV export fails**
- Solution: Check browser download permissions
- Ensure popup blockers are disabled

**Issue: Detail modal doesn't show images**
- Solution: Ensure backend is running on port 5001
- Check that image files exist in `static/uploads/`

**Issue: Filters not working**
- Solution: Click "Search" button after selecting filters
- Date format must be YYYY-MM-DD
